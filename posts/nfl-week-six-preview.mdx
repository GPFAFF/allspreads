  1. Chiefs vs. Bills
</h2>
<div style={{ fontFamily: "monospace", margin: "0 24px" }}>
  In one of the best playoff games in history last year the Bills lost to the Chiefs in OT. The Bills are headed on a revenge tour this year and Vegas is asking you to bet on the Chiefs. Mahomes is 7-0-1 as an underdog and this will be the first time that Mahomes is an underdog at Arrowhead.

The public will be all over the Chiefs, this will be a rare opportunity to back them as a dog at Arrowhead. Therefore take the Bills. The Chiefs defense has been slowly declining and the Bills offense is coming off a huge blowout of Pittsburgh.

  2. London teams head home
</h2>
<div style={{ fontFamily: "monospace", margin: "0 24px" }}>
  The Packers and Giants head home to face a new set of opponents. The Packers take on the Jets and the Giants host the Ravens.

After London, teams tend to let their opponents score some points. The Ravens will face off against old defensive coordinator Wink Martindale. Jackson and the Ravens have practiced against his type of defense for years and we expect a regression to the mean for the Giants. The Ravens have struggled a bit but they get back on track on Sunday and put 28 on the board.

Post London team total overs are now 6-1.

  3. Eagles host Cowboys on Monday Night Football
</h2>
<div style={{ fontFamily: "monospace", margin: "0 24px" }}>
  The Eagles put their undefeated record on the line this week as they take on the Cowboys. Cooper Rush is undefeated as a starter and this will be the first true test the Eagles will face. The Cowboys have been winning on defense with a fierce pass rush, this could be a problem as the Eagles are down a few lineman potentially.

The Eagles have crushed teams in the 1h but have struggled finishing games. They will get a great test this weekend. If the Eagles do win this game, they're likely cruising till November before they will potentially face another "loseable" game.

  <b>Prediction: Cowboys +5</b>

  4. Dead Cat Bounce for the Panthers?
</h2>
<div style={{ fontFamily: "monospace", margin: "0 24px" }}>
  The Panthers fired Matt Rhule this week and Baker Mayfield is injured with a high ankle sprain. Sounds like doom and gloom, but not so fast.

The Panthers might get a dead cat bounce from getting rid of Rhule and statiscally the worst QB in the NFL. PJ Walker is going to take the ball and he and DJ Moore have a pretty decent connection. Expect those targets to go up and utilization of the Panthers best receiver to help them.

The Rams have had some serious Super Bowl hangover. Their offense line is banged up, their defense isn't showing the same pop and Stafford is hurt. 11 points is a huge number to cover for a team that just flat out doesn't look good right now.

11 points is a ton in the NFL but we like this dead cat to bounce and the Panthers to cover.

  5. Broncos in prime-time again?!?
</h2>
<div style={{ fontFamily: "monospace", margin: "0 24px" }}>
 We are subject to watching the Broncos again in prime-time. The NFL is punking us. At least we get to see them play the Chargers which will be a good matchup. Russ Wilson was diagnosed with a torn lat late last week and the Broncos brass is hoping that his struggles are chalked up to injury.

The spread is odd in this game. The Broncos have looked terrible yet they're continually priced by Vegas like they have a chance. They're 5.5 point dogs this week and their offense is putrid. Their defense however comes to play every week. We like the Chargers team total under.

  <b>Prediction: Chargers Team Total Under 26.5</b>
