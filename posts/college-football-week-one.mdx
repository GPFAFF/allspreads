  1. Georgia Bulldogs. Confirmed still elite.
</h2>
<div style={{ fontFamily: "monospace", margin: "0 24px" }}>
  #3 Georgia continued to show dominance by drubbing #11 Oregon 49-3. Stetson
  Bennett picked up where he left off on his title game performance by going
  25-31 for 368 and 2 TD's. After being written off for J.T. Daniels early in
  his career, he continues to keep the Georgia Bulldogs humming as they
  destroyed the Ducks. The Bo Nix experience traveled out West and delivered a
  gem of 21/37 for 173 and 2 INT's. Oregon Fans are THRILLED! Georgia bettors
  cash in early with a no doubter as the -17 point favorites cruise easily to
  victory.

  2. Appalachian State and North Carolina connect for Week One's most electric
  game
</h2>
<div style={{ fontFamily: "monospace", margin: "0 24px" }}>
  During the early slate, these two in-state teams matched up in an absolute
  throwdown. Appalachian State put up 40 points alone in the 4th quarter to come
  back and tie it several times, only to be outlasted by the Tarheels. The
  Mountaineers had multiple chances to win the game outright on two point
  conversions but a few errant throws held them back. In perhaps the easiest bet
  of the day, the over 55.5 cashed alone in the 4th quarter.

  3. Ohio State and Notre Dame clash at the Shoe in an early #2 v #5 matchup
</h2>
<div style={{ fontFamily: "monospace", margin: "0 24px" }}>
  In the premier slot of the night, Notre Dame controlled the clock and was
  dominant for three quarters but eventually was outlasted by a deeper Ohio
  State roster. Their game plan to keep C.J. Stroud and the Ohio State offense
  off the field worked for three quarters and had them in charge making The
  Irish were a lock to cover +17. This also kept the total low for the majority
  of the game. The Buckeyes eventually put together a back-to-back key long 4th
  quarter drives to secure the W, but the public took the L as the majority of
  bettors took Ohio State -17 and the Over 59.5.

  4. Purdue v Penn State and The Backyard Brawl on Opening Night were insanity
</h2>
<div style={{ fontFamily: "monospace", margin: "0 24px" }}>
  College Football fans were served a double dose of insanity on Thursday as two
  of the best games of the week welcomed back fans. 8 months since the last snap
  of College Football, fans were treated to two games playing at a break-neck
  pace. The Backyard Brawl reconvened after an 11-year hiatus. Pittsburgh came
  back from the dead to cover and/or push depending on your line and most
  bettors lost their Under 50.5 as 49 points alone were scored in the 2H. A pick
  6 for Pittsburgh was the catalyst to lift the Panthers to the W.
  Simultaneously Penn State was at Purdue in another punch-for-punch matchup. 7
  lead changes and Purdue was down 11 at the half. Purdue came back to take the
  lead on the back of a "Puke 6". Defender Chris Jefferson lost his lunch after
  putting the Boilermakers up 31-28, however, Clifford and the Nittany Lions got
  the last laugh scoring in the last minute of regulation to win. This put Penn
  State as a 13-3-1 ATS in September games, an extremely profitable record and
  something to keep note heading into next week and the opener of 2023.

  5. Targeting continues to be a problem
</h2>
<div style={{ fontFamily: "monospace", margin: "0 24px" }}>
  The targeting rule is an issue in every college game. Replay officials buzzing
  in, refs calling targeting that isn't, targeting not getting called when it
  is. The major issue is the gray area around the rule, it is all subjective. If
  you're a fan of College Football, there is no doubt that your team has been
  affected by this asinine rule. Additionally, the player, whether intentional
  or not is ejected. We understand the intention behind the rule is for player
  safety but the rule needs to be clarified. If it is targeting is deemed to be
  intentional, then yes, throw the player out, but don't DQ a player in
  reactionary play that happens in a game that is lightning quick. Sometimes
  there is no other move for a defender to make. Hopefully, they will figure it
  out eventually, however, it is the NCAA and they will continue to make
  terrible move after terrible move because that is just what Mark Emmert does.
