  1. PAC-12’s top teams roll
</h2>
<div style={{ fontFamily: "monospace", margin: "0 24px" }}>
 In college football, Los Angeles is undefeated heading into week 6, with USC and UCLA both standing at 5-0. After nearly collapsing in Corvallis the week before, USC easily defeated Arizona State at home. After allowing some big plays against Arizona State and former Florida Gators quarterback Emory Jones, their defense still needs to gel. On the other hand, with the exception of that close game last week, their offense hasn't missed a beat all season.

Washington traveled to UCLA, ranked 15th, on a rare Friday night game and was rolled by UCLA. They led by 24 points after scoring 40 points to start the fourth quarter. They did slack off a little bit, allowing Washington to re-enter the game and end with a final score of 40-32, which makes it appear closer than it was. Dorian Thompson-Robinson, their quarterback, appears to be the conference's second-best quarterback right now, trailing only Caleb Williams of crosstown rival USC. This season, he has 14 touchdowns and only one interception. If they can keep winning, it will be a fun rivalry game against these two at the end of the season. The Sportsbooks had UCLA at +3 after Washington came off a huge blowout win against Michigan State. This raised some eyebrows and called out that UCLA shoulda been the play.

Speaking of continuing their winning ways, UCLA will visit another scorching Pac 12 team in Utah the following week. After early-season hiccups, both Utah and Oregon have recently looked fantastic. Utah has been outstanding, even defeating an Oregon State team that had a chance to win when it went to USC late in the fourth quarter. Oregon has mostly followed in Oregon's footsteps, and the two teams likely face off later in the year, maybe for the Pac 12 Championship.

  2. Alabama loses Young, continues to roll
</h2>
<div style={{ fontFamily: "monospace", margin: "0 24px" }}>
 The fact that Bryce Young was hit hard late in the second quarter and was unable to continue the game on Saturday must have made the entire state of Alabama hold their breath. Despite the fact that it was his throwing shoulder, the injury was only a minor AC sprain, and he could return as soon as next week. Even without Young, Alabama easily won the game.

When Young left the game and was replaced by sophomore Jalen Milroe, the offense started to lose steam and they had a 28 point advantage. Arkansas even managed to get the score as low as 5 points thanks to an onside kick and a strong running game before Alabama grabbed control in the fourth quarter and won the game 49-26. After dropping their past two games, Arkansas has appeared to come back to earth. With KJ Jefferson only passing for 155 yards the previous week, their offense has been rather one-dimensional the last two weeks. Treylon Burks, their outstanding wide receiver from last season, who was selected in the first round, it appears that his loss has had a bigger impact on the offense than was anticipated before the season even started. Arkansas bettors let out a collective yell as the Sportsbooks had them at +17, on 4th down late in the game they were stopped going into the endzone which would have given Arkansas a back door cover.

  3. Oklahoma is in a freefall
</h2>
<div style={{ fontFamily: "monospace", margin: "0 24px" }}>
It's difficult to lose a brilliant head coach, and I can relate to Oklahoma fans who lost one of the nation's top offensive brains during the summer. They were seriously affected by the transfer portal as well, you would have expected that when they added Brent Venables, the defense would be their strongest point. Their defense has been more of a hindrance than anything else this year and add in last week's 31-point defeat, it's left fans scratching their heads. Even in the Big 12, a conference notorious for not playing defense, this team's recent two-week scoring deficit of 91 points is absurd. Although it nearly seems as though the squad has given up, they should still be the most skilled team in the Big 12 based on recruitment, so you know they have the horses. The issue for Oklahoma is that things won't get any easier when they meet Texas in the Red River Rivalry in Dallas the following week. Texas is expected to get 5 Start QB Quinn Ewers back and in addition to the defense being a significant issue, Dillon Gabriel's availability for this week's game against Texas is in serious doubt. Gabriel was injured against TCU last week. There is no doubt that Oklahoma must win this upcoming game if they hope to save their season.

  4. Is Georgia sleepwalking or a pretender?
</h2>
<div style={{ fontFamily: "monospace", margin: "0 24px" }}>
  Kirby Smart sounded off on Saturday after Georgia had their second close game
  to relatively bottom feeder teams in two weeks. "The SEC is challenging. The
  SEC is difficult, so you had best be ready before going on the road. After
  narrowly defeating Mizzou on the road on Saturday, Kirby Smart blared the
  conference horn in his post-game address. For some reason, there is a myth
  that every week, whoever you face, the game will be harder to win if they are
  wearing the SEC patch on their jersey. Kirby Smart should be informed that
  this is the biggest fabrication in college football. This Mizzou team got
  smashed by Kansas State by 28 points in week 2. In conference road games are
  tough in any conference, but it doesn’t change the fact that Mizzou is not
  that good. In week 2, this Missouri squad was destroyed by Kansas State by a
  score of 28. Even if it is difficult to travel for conference games, Mizzou is
  still not a very strong team. It also doesn't change the fact that Georgia and
  Kent State's game in week four was tied at ten points entering the fourth
  quarter. I'm not sure how to feel about Georgia; in their first three games,
  they appeared to be unbeatable, but during the past two weeks, they haven't
  played like the nation's top team. I'm interested to watch how they develop
  since it appears like you could slow down their attack if you took away
  Bowers, their top playmaker.

  5. Paul Chryst gets the axe
</h2>
<div style={{ fontFamily: "monospace", margin: "0 24px" }}>

Paul Chryst was unexpectedly fired last weekend in a Sunday afternoon news dump after posting a 67-26 record over the previous seven years at Wisconsin. Going forward, Jim Leonhard, their current defensive coordinator, will serve as interim coach. This is a decision that stunned many in the college football world and drew analogies to the Bo Pelini situation at Nebraska and although Wisconsin was 2-3 this year and didn't even appear to be very good. While they nearly had the same record, Nebraska haven't been the same since Nebraska fired Pelini, and some people are questioning if Wisconsin is headed in the same direction. The grass isn't always greener on the other side, as the proverb goes, but they do have a young, up-and-coming interim coach in Leonhard who now has a number of games to demonstrate that he is the ideal person for the position. In addition to having played for Wisconsin, Leonhard has been coaching there since 2016. Since taking over as defensive coordinator in 2017, he has led some of the greatest defenses in the nation. One wonders if Wisconsin made this decision because Leonhard would have attracted interest from potential head coaching candidates in the future or if they wanted another Wisconsin native to succeed Lance Leipold because it would be a tremendous risk/reward for them. Wisconsin will try and uphold last weeks trend of interim coaches getting the ATS cover a week after their team fired their head coach. Georgia Tech and Arizona State accomplished that feat this past week.
