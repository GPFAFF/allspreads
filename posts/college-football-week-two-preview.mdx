  1. Sark v Saban
</h2>
<div style={{ fontFamily: "monospace", margin: "0 24px" }}>
 In 26 games against former assistants, Nick Saban has lost only three games. On Saturday, Steve Sarkisian will attempt to join a select group of coaches that includes Lane Kiffin, Jimbo Fisher, and Kirby Smart.Â 

The Alabama Crimson Tide head to Austin to take on the Texas Longhorns at 12:00 EST. Alabama opened at 17.5 points as favorites, but that number was quickly wagered heavily and now sits at 20. Saban seems angry. He had a tense press conference leading into this weekend's game, trading barbs with reporters. He also had a sparring match in the media with Jimbo Fisher, a tit for tat around Alabama and Texas A&M's recruiting practices.

Texas comes in with a new QB in Ohio State transfer Quinn Ewers and star running back Bijan Robinson, but will they have enough firepower to keep up with Alabama? The line of 17.5 that moved to 20 seems to be too low in our opinion. Perhaps we see a late back door cover. However, as we saw Monday night with Clemson and Dabo Swinney, perhaps the Tide will come rolling in and make a statement.

  2. Anthony Richardson's Heisman odds skyrocket
</h2>
<div style={{ fontFamily: "monospace", margin: "0 24px" }}>
  Anthony Richardson was supposed to be the starter at Florida last year. However, a pulled hamstring and an inept coach in Dan Mullen had other plans. Florida fans were left pulling their hair out all last season as they saw Emery Jones make the same mistake over and over again.

Since then, Dan Mullen has been shipped out, and Richardson played an amazing game against Utah on Saturday. Richardson was admirable at throwing, going 17-24 for 168 yards, but it was with his legs that he really showed out, averaging 9.6 yards a carry and finishing with 11 carries for 106 yards and 3 TDs. He also submitted his "most insane play of the year" candidate on a 2 point conversion where he ball faked a defender so badly it made them look stupid.

The college world took notice as his Heisman odds went from 60-1 down to 18-1. There is a long way to go this season, but if Richardson can build on his game against Utah and keep putting up numbers, he could find himself on stage in New York in December.

  3. Huge Big Ten Favorites
</h2>
<div style={{ fontFamily: "monospace", margin: "0 24px" }}>
The Big Ten powerhouses of Ohio State and Michigan get tune-up games this Saturday. Ohio State takes on Arkansas State and Michigan hosts Hawaii. The spreads on these games are some of the largest you will see all season. Ohio State is currently favored by 43.5 and Michigan is favored by 51.5.

The 51.5 point spread is the largest in Michigan football history. Michigan is coming off a 51-7 win over Colorado State. This game is expected to be a blowout. While the spread might be high, this game should land right around there. We expect a fast start out of Michigan and like the first quarter over 13.5.

At The Horseshoe, the Buckeyes took care of business against #5 Notre Dame. The offense struggled at times, but the defense, led by new coordinator Jim Knowles, shut the Irish out in the second half. We expect the Buckeyes offense to find its form on Saturday and cover this extremely large spread. The offense gets it right and should put at least 50 on the board while the defense continues to gel and improve on its performance from Saturday.

  4. #20 Kentucky heads to The Swamp to play #12 Florida
</h2>
<div style={{ fontFamily: "monospace", margin: "0 24px" }}>
Florida shot up the rankings with a huge win over #7 Utah. They capitalized on two huge Utah mistakes and escaped with the win.

Kentucky, meanwhile, battered Miami of Ohio on the arm of Will Levis. Florida has historically dominated Kentucky with an all-time record of 53-19 and sported a 31-game win streak from 1987 to 2017. In the last four years, the two teams have split, and Kentucky has done a good job of making these games way more interesting and competitive while improving its football program over the last ten years.

The current spread has the Gators at-5.5 with an Over/Under of 52.5. Early public action has bettors backing Anthony Richardson and the Gators at almost a 60% advantage. The heavy lean from the public, however, is on the over. These two teams should get into a track meet, and we expect to see a lot of scoring on Saturday in The Swamp.

  5. Tenn V Pitt
</h2>
<div style={{ fontFamily: "monospace", margin: "0 24px" }}>
  #24 Tennessee travels to #17 Pittsburgh as 6.5 point favorites in another top
  25 matchup across the NCAA College Football landscape. That line is extremely
  suspect. We were expecting something around 4, and coming off an emotional win
  in the Backyard Brawl, may be in for a letdown. Tennesee is coming off
  throttling Ball State 59-10. Both of these teams can score Kedon Slovis, the
  USC transfer, played very well in his first game, throwing for over 300 yards
  and Tennessee wracked up over 200 yards on the ground. We like a lot of
  scoring in this game and are eyeing the over at 66.5. Although that is a lot
  of points, both teams' defenses are nothing to write home about.
