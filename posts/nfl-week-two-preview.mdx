  1. Can Brady finally get over the hump against the Saints?
</h2>
<div style={{ fontFamily: "monospace", margin: "0 24px" }}>

Since winning the Super Bowl in 2003, Tampa Bay has struggled. But, since his arrival, all Brady has done is beat a Chiefs team that was heavily favored in the Super Bowl and keep his team winning. Brady has a 25-9 record with the Buccaneers since his arrival.  In a league where Tom Brady has beaten everyone, he has yet to beat the Saints since moving to Tampa Bay. The Buccaneers did best the Saints in the playoffs but that does not count towards your overall record.

Similar to his struggles against the Giants in the Super Bowl, the Saints' pass rush has been a major factor in his struggles. Brady has been sacked 13 times and has thrown 9 interceptions in his games vs. the Saints. The Buccaneers are -3 heading into this weekend, and that number, along with the question of how long Tom can go winless against the Saints, should pique the public's interest. He's one of the most successful quarterbacks in history, so we'd expect a return to winning ways on Sunday and are backing the Buccaneers -3 sunday.

  2. Thursday night football clash between Mahomes and Herbert
</h2>
<div style={{ fontFamily: "monospace", margin: "0 24px" }}>

Last season, the Chiefs and Chargers combined for 54 and 62 points in two of the season's most exciting games. Last year, the Chiefs struggled out of the gate, causing panic alarms to go off from Chiefs fans in early September. The Chargers went into Kansas City and played an outstanding game, taking advantage of four Mahomes turnovers and winning 30-24 with a fourth-quarter comeback. Late in December, the Chiefs returned the favor in a pivotal game that effectively ended the Chargers' playoff chances. Both Mahomes and Herbert are dynamic franchise quarterbacks who can compete at any time. We're in for a great quarterback battle.

The two AFC West division favorites, the Chiefs (+150) and the Chargers (+200), have lofty goals for 2022. The Chargers are looking for Khalil Mack and JC Jackson at cornerback to help them improve on what held them back last year, defense.  Mahomes lost Tyreek Hill but is eager to show that he can win without him, cementing himself as THE top AFC quarterback.

The game's over/under is set at 54.5. In the last seven times that the over/under on a Thursday night game has been that high, the under has come in at an average of 13 points lower than the gametime total. When these two teams get together, scoring appears to be an easy task. Just look at the last two games of last year; they averaged around 58 points in those two games. We're going under though, with better defense on the Chargers side and the missing of some key weapons on the Chiefs, pairing that with some early season miscues, we anticipate this game to go below the scoring trends of 2021.

  3. Lamar Jackson is betting on himself
</h2>
<div style={{ fontFamily: "monospace", margin: "0 24px" }}>

On Friday, the fifth-year quarterback and Ravens qb ceased contract talks. The deal was rumored to be worth around $250 million, with 160 million guaranteed. Jackson, who represents himself, is seeking an agreement similar to that of Deshaun Watson, with all guaranteed money. The issue is that he's two years removed from his MVP season. Jackson would argue that Watson recently received a full-time guaranteed contract and hasn't played a down in nearly two years. The Ravens balked at his contract offer and Jackson is going to play this season to try and jusitfy the contract. It is a real boom vs. bust strategy.

People all over the league have been slamming the Cleveland Browns for this contract, but some GMs say it's a smart move because Jackson and Joe Burrow of the Bengals have contracts expiring soon. Now, the Browns' front office has never been known for making bold moves, so it will be interesting to see how this plays out. But it could for two division rivals to overpay for their QB's and potentially even get them out of the division. The Ravens face the Dolphins this week in one of the NFL's marquee matchups for week 2. The Dolphins have been completely retooled, while the Ravens remain September darlings. Their record in September is nothing to ignore and the first quarter under is our favorite bet in the this game. Their 1Q under record is 14-3-1 and this could be a tight game with a recalibrated Dolphins defense.

  4. Geno Smith stays undefeated against the spread
</h2>
<div style={{ fontFamily: "monospace", margin: "0 24px" }}>

Geno Smith is now 9-0 against the spread since 2014, which is incredible given the turmoil he faced early in his career. His quotes from the game against Denver and Russell Wilson on Monday night said it all. "Everyone dismissed me, but I didn't respond."

Coming out of college, Geno Smith was regarded as a great dual threat quarterback, but his time with the Jets was marred by immaturity, poor play, and a broken jaw from an unpaid bet. His career was in a state of flux until he arrived in Seattle and was mentored by Pete Carroll.

Geno has filled in admirably for the Seahawks while Russell Wilson has been out with an injury. This year is his second chance to start over. Geno isn't going to win you a Super Bowl, but you're not interested in Super Bowls if you're a bettor; you're interested in covering the spread. Smith is now 9-0 ATS after a huge win over the Broncos on Monday night.

Something has to give, and we believe the rocket will come crashing down this week against the 49ers. Geno Smith is a nice Cinderella/redemption story, but San Francisco has struggled recently against Seattle, losing their last 5 games. We like the under in this game because it should be low-scoring and defensive, and we also like the Niners to cover after the Seahawks' huge emotional win on Monday night.

  5. Can the Bears finally exercise the Aaron Rodgers the demons?
</h2>
<div style={{ fontFamily: "monospace", margin: "0 24px" }}>
  During his time as a Packers quarterback, Aaron Rodgers tormented Chicago Bears fans. After scrambling for a touchdown last year in Chicago, Rodgers even told the crowd, "I own you." Rodgers has an ATS record of 21-7 and an SU record of 23-5. The Bears are coming off a rain-soaked 19-10 victory over the Niners. Soldier Field looked like a goddamn water park after three inches of rain. The Packers are coming off a humiliating loss in Minnesota, where their entire game plan seemed to go awry.

Rodgers had a wide receiver streak down the field wide open and drop a walk-in touchdown on the first play of the game, it was an easy 7 and would have gotten the Packers season started with a bang, but the ball careened off his hands and left Rodgers visibly upset, lamenting the wide receivers he has in his wide receiver room. This should be an easy win for the Packers, who have dominated the Bears' offensive line for what seems like the last ten years. Will they, however, be caught looking ahead with Tampa and waiting in the wings the following week?

Expect a more prominent run game with Aaron Jones and AJ Dillon, as well as more designed passing routes to the backs to compensate for the wide receivers' lack of separation on Sunday. Given how both teams performed last week, 10 points may appear to be a lot, but they're clearly taking into account Rodgers' history of dominance against the Bears. In these games, the Packers tend to start slowly and are now 3-16 ATS when covering the first quarter spread. If the Bears can keep Aaron Rodgers off the field, the Bears 1Q should be easy to cash. So were taking the Bears with the points in the first quarter and hoping that the trend would continue.
