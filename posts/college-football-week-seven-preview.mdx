  1. First huge Big-10 game of the year
</h2>
<div style={{ fontFamily: "monospace", margin: "0 24px" }}>
This Saturday, in what will likely be the biggest Big 10 game of the year thus far, Penn State will travel to Ann Arbor to take on an unbeaten Michigan squad. Both teams enter in unbeaten with Michigan appearing more impressive so far this year. Due to the fact that this game will be played at home and the fact that Michigan hasn't had any trouble against any of their opponents, they are now favored by 7 points. They have a running back named Blake Corum who is already in the top 10 in the country with double digit touchdowns and 735 rushing yards. On the other hand, Penn State has improved their running attack this season. Nicholas Singleton and Kaytron Allen, a two-headed freshmen monster, are in charge of them. Singleton, who averages 7.3 yards per rush, occasionally resembles Saquon Barkley. Considering that Michigan is averaging 43 points a game so far this season, it appears that Vegas expects some defense to show up since the game's over/under is only 51 points. Because Penn State matches Michigan's strengths so well, this will be a challenging game for Michigan. This year, Michigan's entire offense has revolved around controlling the line of scrimmage and relying heavily on Blake Corum. Penn State could achieve in its goals if it can halt the run and force an inexperienced JJ McCarthy to chuck the ball. Sean Clifford, a seasoned quarterback for Penn State, is aware that he won't let you lose the game. They're going to try to make this into a brawl therefore McCarthy has to win, in my opinion. In this game, I wouldn't touch a clear winner, but I like the over.

  2. SoCalâ€™s first real test
</h2>
<div style={{ fontFamily: "monospace", margin: "0 24px" }}>
Utah hasn't yet faced a team as strong as Utah, even though they lost last week to a another Los Angeles-based team that might be USC's biggest Pac 12 rival this season. Utah is favored by 3.5 points in its home game on Saturday, according to Vegas. At Rice-Eccles Stadium, where Utah is 85-21 under Kyle Whittingham, USC will be playing in a hostile environment for the first time this season against a ranked opponent. Caleb Williams, who has 14 touchdown passes and just one interception so far this season, has been leading the Trojans' dominance over their opponents. But rather than the offense, USC should be most concerned about the defense coming into this game. 152 of the 351 yards that USC gives up each game are on the ground. For rushing defense, they are not in the top 60 in the nation. Because Utah is so good at that, this is a significant concern. Utah hasn't shown to be a very strong defensive team this season, as 4 of their previous 6 games have gone over. We should anticipate some late-night scoring when this game begins because the O/U is 65 points. Since Utah only allows one sack per game, and even though USC's run defense hasn't been terrific, it has shown the ability to get to the quarterback, I believe that this game will be decided in the trenches. USC and the over in this game are still my favorites.

  3. Third Saturday in October
</h2>
<div style={{ fontFamily: "monospace", margin: "0 24px" }}>
In this rivalry game, Alabama has defeated Tennessee 15 times in a row. I'm not sure what will inspire this Vols squad if that fails to inspire them. This Saturday's game in Knoxville has Alabama favored by 7.5 points, however that number would likely be higher if we knew how healthy Bryce Young was. For the Vol's, who are trying to prove that they can compete with the SEC's big powers once more, this might be their biggest game since the early 2000s. Not just the 15-game losing record is at stake; Alabama has defeated the SEC East in 27 straight regular-season contests. Bama has been successful against the spread this year, going 4-2; however, they have largely accomplished this through defense, going over only twice thus far. This is more in line with Alabama's early 2010 teams than it is with recent performances. The offense for the Vols, on the other hand, ranks second in terms of points scored and total yards per game. As a result, they have won 3 out of their last 5 overs. The Vols' team's one significant, obvious flaw is that they allow 307 yards via the air each game. If Bryce Young is healthy and able to participate in this game, he should put up some incredible statistics. That is the game's most obvious flaw thus far. If Bryce Young plays and can chuck the ball, it may be a long afternoon in Knoxville even if I believe the Vols can win.

  4. Big 12 supremacy
</h2>
<div style={{ fontFamily: "monospace", margin: "0 24px" }}>
Since the Big 12 uses a round-robin format, it is well known that anyone may win the conference. The final two undefeated clubs square off on Saturday, which will be a pivotal game in deciding who will grab the lead. In the afternoon game on Fox, the Pokes from Oklahoma State will travel to TCU. After narrowly defeating a young Kansas team on the road last week, TCU is favored by 4 points. So far this year, Oklahoma State hasn't had a final score that was within ten. Behind senior quarterback Spencer Sanders, who has 12 touchdowns this season, they are sixth in scoring. The last time TCU played this Oklahoma State team they lost 63-17 in a game without their star quarterback Max Duggan. Duggan has been nothing but spectacular this year having 14 touchdowns and a qbr of 88.6 which is good enough to be 5th in the nation. With an over of 68.5 expect some points to be scored as OSU is 4/5 in their overs this year and TCU is 3/5. With the exception of last week's game against Kansas, which was a push, TCU has covered every game they have played so far this season. One of these teams must continue to be unbeaten, and given how well they are currently playing, I believe TCU has the advantage at home. TCU minus four, with the over.

  5. Big Orange
</h2>
<div style={{ fontFamily: "monospace", margin: "0 24px" }}>
Syracuse has been this year's other unexpected team, along with Kansas. The start for Syracuse has been the best since 1987. On the other side, NC State is also having a fantastic year, with their lone loss coming to Clemson. A victory by the Orange would not only qualify Syracuse for bowl season for the first time in four years, but it would also set up a matchup against No. 4 Clemson the following Saturday for first place in the division. With a 42-point over/under and Syracuse having a 4.5-point advantage, it appears that this game will be decided on defense. Due to their success thus far this season as a surprise team, Syracuse has been 4/5 against the spread this year. Although I believe NC State has the superior squad coming into their showdown against Syracuse on Saturday, strange things have been known to occur there. There ought to be a full house. The Orange has comfortably sold the most tickets this season with more than 45,000 sold for the game. A ranked Syracuse squad will face a ranked ACC opponent for the first time since the Orange entered the league in 2013. I still believe NC State will dominate and control the game's tempo.
