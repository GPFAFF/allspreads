  1. Witching hour part one - Browns vs. Jets
</h2>
<div style={{ fontFamily: "monospace", margin: "0 24px" }}>

In what seemed like a boring early slate as we reached the transition to the late games, the witching hour took full effect.

In Cleveland, Nick Chubb and the Browns had played a fairly dominant game, scoring to make the score 30-14 with 1:55 remaining. Cade York, the previous week's hero, lined up for his PAT but missed. Isn't it a non-issue? The witching hour spell began to work. With no timeouts, the Jets scored on a two-play drive capped by a 66-yard bomb to Corey Davis. A blown coverage for the Browns, whether they should have been in Cover 2 or Cover 3, resulted in some blame game tweets from Cleveland's 100 million dollar corner Denzel Ward the next day.

Still, the Browns only needed to recover the onside kick and kneel out the game to earn their first 2-0 start since 1993. Unfortunately, these things only happen in Cleveland. Amari Cooper fumbled on the onside recovery, giving the Jets the ball at midfield.

Joe Flacco, now 18-3 against the Browns, carved up the defense for a one-minute drive to take the lead. Jacoby Brissett, who had an outstanding game, drove the Browns almost to field goal range before throwing a game-ending interception. When a team was leading by two goals in less than two minutes, the score was 2239 - 0. Who was the last team to do it? The Cleveland Browns in 2001, you guessed it. A franchise that finds the most inventive ways to lose while also torturing fans.

  2. Witching hour part two - Dolphins vs. Ravens
</h2>
<div style={{ fontFamily: "monospace", margin: "0 24px" }}>

Witching hour strikes again, part deux.

Lamar Jackson was performing the money dance in Baltimore. Jackson had an outstanding first three quarters, leading the Ravens to a 35-14 lead entering the fourth quarter. Jackson had three touchdowns and over 100 yards on the ground, and he was convincing the Ravens to back up the Brinks truck. That is, until Tua and the Dolphins breached and began dropping bomb after bomb. Tua threw for 469 yards, and Tyreek Hill and Jayleek Waddle each had 11 receptions for 170 and 190 yards.

In fact, it was someone using the Pickswise app. Check them out at <a href="https://pickswise.com">Pickswise.com</a>, where they advertised a parlay for Tua to go over 300 and both Waddle and Hill to go over 100, which paid 28 to 1. That guy made an incredible call. Anyway, the Ravens appeared to be in command throughout the game, until the Dolphins outscored them 28-3 in the fourth quarter, shocking everyone from Ravens players to fans. The Dolphins game plan appeared to be straightforward: either Waddle or Hill, two of the fastest wide receivers in the league, would run go routes while the other ran a drag route underneath. Mike McDaniels has this offense humming like it's on Madden. Pair that with his gameday Jordan's and his stance on Cannabis and you can see why he is becoming one of the darlings of the league as a rookie head coach.

  3. Witching hour part three - Cardinals vs. Raiders
</h2>
<div style={{ fontFamily: "monospace", margin: "0 24px" }}>

Kyler Murray and the Cardinals completed the third incredible comeback in Las Vegas. The Raiders led 23-7 entering the fourth quarter and appeared to dominate the entire game. Their offense, on the other hand, stalled, and the Cardinals gradually chipped away. In the stands, Raiders fans were spraying champagne like the fame was over as the game entered the fourth quarter. It looked like a Vegas pool scene from Marquee. But oh how the Witching Hour devils will strike.

But then Dachshund of the Desert showed up and outscored the Raiders 16-0 in the fourth quarter, capped by an insane scramble that traveled 89 yards on one of the game's final plays to tie it up. The Raiders offense was stagnant in overtime but found some life and appeared to be driving for the victory only to fumble the ball away twice and have it returned for a score by the Cardinals defense. Call of Duty Murray gets his spawn kill, and the Cardinals bounce back from their Week 1 loss to the Chiefs. They begin divisional play this week against the Rams, who are a +4 favorite.

  4. Lattimore vs. Evans
</h2>
<div style={{ fontFamily: "monospace", margin: "0 24px" }}>

Most athletes in today's professional sports leagues are competitors between the lines and friends off the field; Mike Evans and Marshaun Lattimore are clearly not friends. Evans came flying in like a WWF Superstar after a play was over, knocking Lattimore to the ground in a tightly contested Buccaneers vs. Saints game on Sunday. On the play in question, Lattimore, Tom Brady, and Leonard Fournette sparred.

This is Evans and Lattimore's second altercation; in 2017, a similar incident occurred in the Superdome. Sports, in my opinion, require more athletes who openly dislike one another. The days of Pistons vs. Bulls in the 1990s are long gone, but a good protagonist vs. antagonist rivalry can still get the juices flowing.

Evans was suspended for one game for his actions in the altercation and has now been suspended twice, both for fights with Lattimore. We can't wait to see how the trilogy battles out later in the season. It'll almost certainly be more entertaining than Canelo vs. GGG.

  5. Unders dominate
</h2>
<div style={{ fontFamily: "monospace", margin: "0 24px" }}>
  With all of the rule changes that have been implemented in a league that favors scoring, it's kind of interesting to see the majority of NFL games go under. The league has gone out of it's way to improve scoring and create rules which favor offense. Let's face we all love scoring.

However the under continues hit at a large clip where 69% of the games so far have hit the under. In primetime games, the under is now 6-1, or 7-0 depending on when you bet the Bills vs. Titans game. The pattern does not end there. Overs have only been hit in 31% of games this season. Only the Falcons, Lions, Browns, and Commanders are 2-0 on the season in terms of exceeding their total.

Will this pattern continue? In previous years, the majority of teams hit the under more often than not. Since 2018, for example, only ten teams have hit more overs than unders, with percentages averaging around 58 to 59%. There will be teams that get very hot on overs, the Raiders of 2020 hit at a 75% clip, the Vikings of last year hit at 64%, so the question this year is who will be the team that consistently hits their over number.
