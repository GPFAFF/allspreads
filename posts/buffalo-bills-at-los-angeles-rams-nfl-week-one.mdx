  1. Are the Rams being slept on?
</h2>
<div style={{ fontFamily: "monospace", margin: "0 24px" }}>
    Every season, it seems like the Rams sell the farm to acquire stars at the deadline only to fall short. Currently, they won't pick in the first round for the next 7 years. In the 2021–2022 NFL season, the chickens came home to roost as mortgaging their first-round picks for Matt Stafford and Von Miller brought LA a Super Bowl 56 victory. The Rams under McVeigh have been to two Super Bowls and have a record of 55-26. While they are talked about as one of the best teams in the NFC, they are usually in that second tier when the conversation is being had. And they again appear to be the forgotten men year after year, with teams like the Packers, Buccaneers, and Cowboys receiving the majority of the attention.

    Can they repeat in the 2022-2023 NFL season? No team has won back to back Super Bowls since the New England Patriots accomplished this feat in 2003-04. Their division is there for the taking which puts them in a good spot to try and repeat. The Seahawks shipped out Russel Wilson, the 49ers are starting a rookie in Trey Lance, and Arizona continues to be an underachieving squad due to Kyler Murray's Call of Duty addiction. While they are likely the favorites in the division, it will remain to be seen if they can survive a Super Bowl hangover.

  2. Can Bills live up to the hype?
</h2>
<div style={{ fontFamily: "monospace", margin: "0 24px" }}>
   For the first time since the K-Gun offense, the Buffalo Bills are the odds-on favorites to win the Super Bowl, coming in at around 6-1. After coming up short against Kansas City in the Playoffs in what some called the best NFL playoff game ever, the Bills hit the offseason hard and made some great moves.

    The Bills added Von Miller and Shaq Lawson to help boost the pass rush. They also added some offensive line help in the form of David Quessenberry and Roger Saffold from the Titans. Josh Allen is cementing himself as one of the best QBs in the NFL, and the team has the people in Buffalo vibing about the possibilities. While the preseason favorite has only won the Super Bowl 6 times—New England, San Francisco twice, Dallas, and Indianapolis—the Bills aim to become the 7th team, and they just might have the roster to do it. The Buffalo Bills and their fans are on the short list of NFL franchises and fan bases that deserve a Super Bowl. Meanwhile folding table sales have skyrocketed in anticipation for this upcoming Bills season.

  3. Bills -2.5 and Over 50.5 receive heavy amount of public action
</h2>
<div style={{ fontFamily: "monospace", margin: "0 24px" }}>
    The Buffalo Bills are currently -2.5 point favorites recieving about 68 to 72% from the public. Rightfully so, the Bills have been great to their bettors in Week 1, benefiting from a 12-5 ATS since 2006 in their matchups. This is extremely enticing, and when you pair that with all the offseason hype, it is no wonder they are receiving heavy action. Add in question marks around Stafford's arm, alongside the addition of Von Miller, my guess is that the public will continue to support the Bills on Thursday Night as the NFL season kicks off.

    Call it what you will, but it seems like primetime games in the NFL can be powder kegs for scoring. The public is big on the over, coming in around 70%, so it's fair to say they expect some fireworks for the NFL Season Opener. Is this the right play, though? These two defenses make up some of the best in the league. The Bills were number 1 in total defense last year, and the Rams have Aaron Donald, Jalen Ramsey, and an excellent front line. If the number continues to rise, the under could see some very late line action leading into Thursday, making it a sharp Under play. In 2021, both the Rams and Bills netted out at around a 50% Over to Under ratio.

  4. Can the Bills running game take a step forward?
</h2>
<div style={{ fontFamily: "monospace", margin: "0 24px" }}>
 The Bills were 6th in the NFL in rushing last year, but it was on the back of 763 yards from Josh Allen. The team drafted Zach Moss to help take over the workload, but unfortunately, he was ineffective. Devin Singletary contributed to the volume of touches, but Allen still had 122 carries. Enter James Cook. Cook was drafted with the 63rd pick this past offseason and the Front Office hopes he is the answer. Cook is the younger brother of Dalvin Cook, and if he can exhibit the same big-play ability, it could make Buffalo's offense even more potent than it already is. Then Allen would no longer have to take pummeling shots on designed runs, and it would take some of the pressure off the offense while adding a much more potent play-action ability. My guess is that the Front Office would love to insure their franchise corner stone and disperse those rushing yards into the backfield. Allen has taken some major shots over the years and has had the Front Office holding their breath on several occasions.

  5. Is Matt Staffords arm OK? Von Miller heads back to LA.
</h2>
<div style={{ fontFamily: "monospace", margin: "0 24px" }}>
  People have slept on Matt Stafford's entire career. He finally got the respect he deserved after leading the Rams to a Super Bowl. Stafford, however, has had a hall-of-fame career by today's standards and potentially has solidified his standing.

The alarm bells went off in camp, as they scaled down his workload when Stafford was diagnosed with some arm pain. It's never a good thing for a QB who throws it as well and far as Stafford. One thing is for sure, if he does go out, it significantly hampers the Rams' offense, as they would be starting John Wolford. Wolford only has a career 42 attempts and a QB rating of 53.

Could it be nothing? Yes. Could he need surgery? Also yes. It remains to be seen. Something to keep an eye on moving forward throughout the Rams' season and would significantly hamper their chances of trying to repeat as Super Bowl Champs.
