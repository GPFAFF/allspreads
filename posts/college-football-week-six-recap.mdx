  1. Red River Slaughter
</h2>
<div style={{ fontFamily: "monospace", margin: "0 24px" }}>

Oklahoma dropped three straight games for the first time since 1998, but that
wasn't their only record or streak broken. Additionally, Texas' 49-0 shutout of
OU made this the worst Red River Rivalry defeat for either team. Dillon Gabriel,
the Sooners' starting quarterback, was absent, and it was obvious. With five
players attempting to pass the ball, they could only muster a total of 39 yards.
OU looked dreadful both offensively and defensively. Contrarily, Texas appears
to be the group that almost defeated Alabama in week 2. After getting hurt in
that game, Quinn Ewers came back and passed for 289 yards and 4 touchdowns. They
gained 296 more yards on the ground, just to highlight how terrible the OU run
defense is. In this game, Texas, which now seems to have a quarterback is on the
upward trend, and OU, looks like a team heading in a separate direction. The
real question for OU moving ahead is whether they will make a bowl. They will be
favorites in their final three games of the season, but if they keep up their
recent form, they may finish the campaign watching games from the couch. If
Texas didn't lose Ewers in week 2, I would be really interested to see how good
they would be. If he plays healthy against Alabama, there is a case to be made
that they might be unblemished.

  2. “Life” Valley
</h2>
<div style={{ fontFamily: "monospace", margin: "0 24px" }}>
LSU has earned a reputation for being one of the most challenging home stadiums. The spread for LSU decreased to just 3 as a consequence of that and Tennessee's poor passing defense. Whatever homemade voodoo they had, Tennessee put an end to it by scoring 40 points in a game that was  not as close than the final score suggested. At the end of the third quarter, Tennessee had a fairly outstanding  lead of 37-7. Even though their offense has been the most remarkable aspect of this football team thus far, it wasn't simply that. LSU quarterback Jayden Daniels was sacked five times by Tennessee, with Byron Young accounting for two of those instances. Two turnovers and three turnovers on downs were also a result of their defense. Tennessee actually appears to be the SEC's second-best team so far this season. In contrast to what you have occasionally seen in Georgia or Alabama, they have been a whole package. They'll visit third-ranked Alabama in a matchup of unbeaten teams the following week, so we'll find out how good they are then. Tennessee has to win that game if they want to prove they are among the top in the SEC.

  3. Texas A&M almost pulls of the upset
</h2>
<div style={{ fontFamily: "monospace", margin: "0 24px" }}>
This week, Alabama visited Texas A&M in a game that many predicted would be a rout. The spread got as high as 25 points at one point despite Alabama's absence of their top quarterback Bryce Young. Fans of Alabama who were hoping for some sort of payback for what occurred in the game last year got far more than they bargained for when A&M had a chance to win it on the final play. Alabama held on 24-20. It was nearly a perfect storm for a club like A&M to eke out a victory since Alabama did not play well at all. Texas A&M was able to stay in the game until the final seconds thanks to Bama's season-high 4 turnovers and 2 missed field goals. Remember that Alabama did have a backup quarterback in, and it was clear to see. They focused on their running game and gained 288 yards, which helped them truly take control of the game but prevented them from running away with it. If Bryce Young had played in the game, they would have won easily, but he didn't, which allowed A&M to stay in it. A&M continued to demonstrate their offensive shortcomings by making one of the worst play decisions to win a game as the clock ticked down. Haynes King, the quarterback for Texas A&M, really didn't give Evan Stewart an opportunity to make a play, which is something you have to do if you have a chance to win the game. The odd thing is that Texas A&M wouldn't have lost to App State in week 2 and likely would have given Miss State a tougher battle if they had played the way they did in this game throughout the whole season. If Alabama plays like they did in this game, they will lose against Tennessee. That game is next week and should be the Alabama's toughest game of the year.

  4.  New Pac 12 big dog
</h2>
<div style={{ fontFamily: "monospace", margin: "0 24px" }}>
Utah has defeated UCLA in 5 straight games by a combined score of 27 points. Dorian Thompson-Robinson, the UCLA quarterback, made certain that streak would stop. "Without a doubt, I desired this one. We are all aware of the point discrepancy between UCLA and Utah in the past "Thompson-Robinson stated. By passing for four touchdowns and also scoring one on the run, he outperformed Utah quarterback Cam Rising, who many people think is a superior quarterback. UCLA won 42-32 and dominated the tempo for the majority of the game in what many people saw as Chip Kelly's biggest game as their coach.Zach Charbonnet amassed 198 running yards, a career best, and scored a touchdown. The junior had his fourth 100-yard performance of the year. Particularly in the second half, the attacking performance was particularly excellent. UCLA led 14-10 at the half and 28-18 at the end of the third quarter after scoring on 4 straight offensive possessions. After two defeats, Utah, which entered 2022 as the Pac 12's favorite, doesn't seem likely to build on their success from the previous season. Conversely, UCLA still has the entire season ahead of them before facing Oregon on the road in their next significant test, which will come after a bye week. If UCLA can get past that game with a victory they should be undefeated when they host cross town rival USC later in the season.

  5. Jayhawks dream season ends
</h2>
<div style={{ fontFamily: "monospace", margin: "0 24px" }}>
For the first time since 2009, the Jayhawks entered this game against TCU 5-0, and this season had shadows of 2007. If the Jayhawks' defeat in the Big 12 championship in 2007 hadn't occurred, they could have had a chance to go to the national championship. They attempted to duplicate the magic of that year, but TCU, another hot team, stood in their way. Unfortunately for Kansas, its standout quarterback Jalon Daniels was forced to leave the game in the first half after seemingly hurting his throwing shoulder. The game's backup quarterback Jason Bean performed excellently, passing for 269 yards and 4 touchdowns, but Max Duggan was the day's big story. TCU's quarterback Duggan passed for 308 yards and 3 touchdowns while also scoring on the run. He single-handedly led the Horned Frogs to a 38-31 victory, which wasn't all that different from TCU's first four games. TCU continues to be undefeated and, after a dismal campaign last year, seems to be a threat in the Big 12. Next week, when they visit Oklahoma State, who appears to be their main rival for the Big 12 championship this year.  Kansas, which is already 5-1 and has already surpassed expectations for the year, they have been the greatest surprise team of the season so far. They should get to bowl eligibility but also have 3 ranked opponents in their last 6 games. If Daniels isn’t to banged up I think the Jayhawks could get to an 8-4 mark before the bowls begin.
