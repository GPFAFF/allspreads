  1. Miami inheriting Oregon problems
</h2>
<div style={{ fontFamily: "monospace", margin: "0 24px" }}>
Miami hosted Middle Tennessee this past weekend, paying them 1.5 million dollars, and still lost by 14 points, indicating that something is wrong in Coral Gables. In a season where teams are getting the bag to play big teams while still coming out with game-changing wins, it's a case of having your cake and eating it too. Miami's game plan, a man-to-man defense that head coach Mario Cristobal was known for at Oregon, was their main issue throughout the game. Throughout the game, Miami's athletes believed they were superior to Middle Tennessee's because they believed they could simply show up and outmuscle the Blue Raiders.

This was not the case because Middle Tennessee's wide receivers pounded Miami all day, averaging 16.5 yards per pass the previous week. Tyler Van Dyke appears to be carrying on Justin Herbert's issues under Cristobal. He may not be as skilled as Herbert was at Oregon, but Cristobal has looked terrible since moving here from Oregon. Since Cristobal took over, there hasn't been a single week when their offensive output has been as strong as it should be.

This is now three games under Cristobal where the Hurricanes have struggled mightly. They arguably should have lost to Southern Miss as well two weeks back. The Hurricanes are now 1-3 ATS and things are not sunny in Miami right now.

  2. Clemson Survives
</h2>

Last weekend, Clemson narrowly avoided going into triple overtime in order to defeat a respectable Wake Forest team. Given how well Wake Forest's Hartman played (six touchdowns), they could have easily lost this game. The fact that DJ Uiagalelei was 26/41 for 371 yards and 5 touchdowns is even more impressive. When discussing a Clemson offense that hasn't produced like we're used to seeing when they had Lawrence or Watson, DJ Uiagalelei has been used as a scapegoat the last couple of years. This was most likely his best performance as Clemson's quarterback since making his debut against Notre Dame in 2021.

Clemson's defense has been the bigger surprise so far. When Venables was in charge, the defense was unaccustomed to allowing 447 yards. Despite this, DJ played well enough for Clemson to win and keep their perfect record going into their toughest test of the season against North Carolina State the following Saturday night. NC State is a trendy pick at +6.5 or +7 right now as Clemson has shown weaknesses and they're truly not the #5 team in the country. They have uncharacteristically struggled with ACC opponents as of late and we think there is another struggle coming on Saturday.

  3. Ohio State shows out vs. The Badgers
</h2>
<div style={{ fontFamily: "monospace", margin: "0 24px" }}>
Ohio State led 45-7 heading into the fourth quarter last Saturday night before pulling their starters. Since the first week, there have been some minor concerns about Ohio State's offense. Not that they can't score, but can they do so against a good defense? When you score 52 points against a Jim Leonard defense, as they did last week, it quickly puts a stop to some of that talk.

This Wisconsin team is not as good as some in the past, but they remain a top 15 defense and will most likely be ranked as such by the end of the season. The defense has also caused concern for Ohio State; despite allowing only 21 points before the final horn, one of those touchdowns was scored on a 75-yard run. Wisconsin's starting running back had averaged less than 4 yards per carry on 20 attempts prior to breaking a big one. Wisconsin was only able to pass for 104 yards in total, and despite not being known for their air attack, they were incredibly inefficient when facing this young secondary. Ohio State appears ready to challenge for another Big Ten title and a playoff berth. Ohio State heads to Rutgers on Saturday and is a 42 point favorite. Currently FBS teams who are 4 TD favorites are covering at around 64%. We will see if that trend continues on Saturday.

  4. Vols take down the Gators
</h2>
<div style={{ fontFamily: "monospace", margin: "0 24px" }}>
 squared off. Since Florida has dominated the series since 2000, there hasn't been much of a rivalry. Prior to 2015, their most recent victory came in 2004. The offense for Tennessee was aggressive against Florida, scoring 38 points in the win. Hendon Hooker had an outstanding game, gaining 349 yards through the air and another 112 yards on the ground while scoring three touchdowns. Florida did make a comeback, scoring two touchdowns in the fourth quarter to tie the game at 38-33. In an all-time bad beat for Tennessee backers -10.5, the Vols had the game in hand easily but a questionable call on 4th down gave the Gators the ball at midfield which led to a classic back door cover.

They were able to do so thanks to Anthony Richardson, who returned to his previous playing style against Utah in the first week. He had two rushing touchdowns and nearly 500 yards passing, both of which were season highs. As college football fans, we  should hope he keeps playing like that because he's entertaining to watch. Tennessee's offense can compete with anyone in the SEC, but their defense is woefully underwhelming and will be their undoing when they face more formidable opponents.

  5. Texas, confirmed not back
</h2>
<div style={{ fontFamily: "monospace", margin: "0 24px" }}>
Last Saturday in Lubbock, Texas Tech defeated Texas. The entire game was a dogfight as Tech overcame a two-touchdown deficit. In contrast to Sark, who is entering his second year with a roster that is significantly more talented than Tech's, Tech is still trying to establish its culture and is a young program. When it appeared that Texas was about to pull away, Tech hung on like a bad cold. Despite having fewer turnovers, their 6/8 fourth-down performance was absolutely insane. Despite the fact that Texas' backup quarterback started, the rest of the team was the same as the one that lost to No. 2 Alabama. Things will change as Texas looks to get Quinn Ewers back this week before a game against West Virginia, but it's still a huge blow to Sark, who has only won more than seven games twice as a head coach. The Texas defense which saw an excellent performance against Alabama a few weeks ago has underwhelemed since. Everyone is so quick to annoint Texas back because it is great for the College Football landscape, but how many times will we be fooled? Also how is this team going to compete in the SEC, they have struggled against Big 12 competition and there are no off weeks in SEC conference play.
